# project_zomboid_installer
Install project zomboid server and systemd unit for Ubuntu 20.x

This was not tested on other distros. Some packaged deps may not work on older versions of ubuntu.

To quickly and UNSAFELY install this, simply run

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfalias/project_zomboid_installer/main/pz_ubuntu_installer.sh | sudo bash
```
Piping curl to bash is UNSAFE. READ THE CODE FIRST!


# Usage
Installs a PZ server for ubuntu. Simply run sudo bash ./pz_ubuntu_installer.sh

By default, it will generate an admin password. Otherwise you can specify a password with pz_ubuntu_installer.sh -p MyPassword

Once installed, you must configure your PZ server. See the wiki page for server options

https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Dedicated_Server


# Manage
SSH to your server, and run:

```
su - steam
screen -r
```

This will have your terminal at the PZ admin prompt, where server commands can be entered. 

To safely disconnect with out interrupting the server, press CTRL + A then CTRL + D


# Scheduled reboots
Scheduled reboots are common. As the root user, add an entry into crontab, (use the command crontab -e)

Example server reset at midnight:

```
* 0 0 0 0 systemctl restart Project-Zomboid


```
